# joie
a highly specialized, minimal full-text search engine. 
the next version of https://github.com/kore-signet/curiosity's search engine.

joie's built for small-to-medium datasets. it optimizes for performance over file size. it automatically generates highlighted snippets, without sacrificing search result speed - this does mean there's no opting out of snippet generation, though.
